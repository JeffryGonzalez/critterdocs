We will put notes and things here for some continuity of how this site will work.

For the content, I'm working roughly from the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework, which is a framework for organizing documentation into four categories: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference.

### Tutorials

Tutorials are lessons. They are designed to help developers acquire new knowledge

### How-To Guides

How-to guides are different than tutorials. They are not as *step-by-step* as tutorials, but they are still focused on helping developers accomplish a specific task or solve a problem.

Examples might be:

- How do I set up testing using XUnit or TUnit?
- How do I rebuild projections?
