We are developing a series of tutorials to help meet you where you are in your journey with event sourcing, CQRS, and distributed messaging with the JasperFx Critter Stack.

The first tutorial is a "Happy Path" tutorial that will help you get started with the Critter Stack. It will cover the basics of how to build a simple application using the Critter Stack, focusing on the core concepts and how they fit together.

We have a lot more planned, and are always happy to take requests for future tutorials.

These tutorials are meant to to be a starting point for you to learn the Critter Stack. They are not meant to be exhaustive or cover every possible scenario. Always refer to the documentation for both Marten and Wolverine for more details, and join the Discord to follow the conversations and ask other developers, including members of the JasperFx core team questions.

JasperFx also provides support plans if your needs are beyond what the community can reasonable provide, and we are working on, in addition to this content, a series of training courses led by JasperFx team members to help you and your team get up to speed with the Critter Stack.
