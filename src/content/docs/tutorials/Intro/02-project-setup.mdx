title: Project Setup

import { Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You will need a few things to get started here:

- A Container Runtime (Like Docker Desktop, or Podman, etc.)
- A .NET SDK (Version 9.0 or later)
- A Code Editor (Like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NeoVim, Rider, etc.)
    - I will use Jetbrains Rider in this course, but you can use whatever you like. You can get a free license for Rider for non-commercial use, etc. [See Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Git
- A fairly recent version of Node.js (Version 18 or later) and NPM (Just to get started, but you can also dip into the frontend later, if you are interested)

## Getting the Starter Code

Find (or create) a nice clean directory to work in, and then run the following command to clone the starter code for this course:

```bash
npx gitpick JeffryGonzalez/critterdocs/tree/main/projects/JasperHappyPath_starter
```
This will create a new directory called `JasperHappyPath_starter` in your current directory, and it will copy the starter code into that directory.

Make sure your container runtime is running, and then run the following command to start the Critter Stack:

```bash
cd JasperHappyPath_starter
docker compose up -d
```

In the `JasperHappyPath_starter` directory, `CoursesSolution/CoursesSolution.sln` file. Open that in your editor and run the application.

After the application starts, your browser should open to `https://localhost:7203/app/` and you should see our frontend. 

If you click on the "Courses" link in the header, the application will *attempt* to load a list of courses from our API, but it will fail because we haven't implemented the API yet.

<Card title="The Final Code">
You can also pull down a "final" working copy of this project using the same process as above, but using the following command:

```bash
npx gitpick JeffryGonzalez/critterdocs/tree/main/projects/JasperHappyPath_Final
```
In another directory. Make sure you start the container!
