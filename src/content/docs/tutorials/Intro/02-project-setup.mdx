title: Project Setup
---

You will need a few things to get started here:

- A Container Runtime (Like Docker Desktop, or Podman, etc.)
- A .NET SDK (Version 9.0 or later)
- A Code Editor (Like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NeoVim, Rider, etc.)
    - I will use Jetbrains Rider in this course, but you can use whatever you like. You can get a free license for Rider for non-commercial use, etc. [See Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Git
- A fairly recent version of Node.js (Version 18 or later) and NPM (Just to get started, but you can also dip into the frontend later, if you are interested)
