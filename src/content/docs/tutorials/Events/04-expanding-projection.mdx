title: Adding To Our Projection
---

import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Our `User` projection is pretty simple right now. We'll learn how to add some "rules" and stuff later, but for now, let's just add a little bit of complication to our projection.

Here's what we'll do:
1. Our `User` projection should have a `CreatedOn` property that is set when the user is created.
2. Our system allows our users to change their name. *But* we want to keep a record of every name they've used, if they ever change it.

I'm just making this stuff up at this point, but it will be a good opportunity to show a few interesting things.

## Adding `CreatedOn`

Let's add a new property to our `User` projection:

```diff lang="csharp"
public class User
{
// ...
+    public DateTime CreatedOn { get; set; }
// ...
}
```

We'll add a new method to our test class (the other one is getting a bit chonky):

```csharp
 [Fact]
    public async Task AddingCreatedOn()
    {
        var store = DocumentStore.For(config =>
        {
            config.Connection("host=localhost;database=issues;password=password;username=user");
        });
        await using var session =  store.LightweightSession();
        
        var userStreamId = Guid.NewGuid();
        
        session.Events.StartStream(userStreamId, new UserCreated());
        await session.SaveChangesAsync();
        var user = await session.Events.AggregateStreamAsync<User>(userStreamId);
        
        Assert.NotNull(user);
        user.CreatedOn.ShouldBe(DateTimeOffset.Now, 1.Seconds());
        
    }
```

:::tip[I added a Nuget Package "Shouldly"]
In the test project, I added the Nuget package "Shouldly" to make the assertions a bit easier to read. 
```bash
dotnet add package Shouldly
```
Make sure you add the `using` statement to the top of the file:
```csharp
using Shouldly;
```
:::

The assertion of `user.CreatedOn.ShouldBe(DateTimeOffset.Now, 1.Seconds());` is using Shouldly to say "I know time flies, but as long as the CreatedOn property is within 1 second of now, I'm happy".

That `1.Seconds()` thing is a little extension method provided by the fine folks at JasperFx (the creators of the Critter Stack). Just add a `using JasperFx.Core` to the top of your file, and you can use it too. 
I'm telling you, those folks think of *everything*.


If you run this test now, it should <Badge text="Fail" variant="danger" />.  The `CreatedOn` property is just initialized to `DateTimeOffSet` default when the `User` is created.

We are currently telling Marten that when it sees a `UserCreated` event, it should create a new `User` object. But we haven't told it what to do with the `CreatedOn` property. There is only so much you can do in the constructor,
so we'll get rid of it, and use another Marten *convention* (like "`Apply`") called `Create` to know what event should be used to create the projection.

If you remember, Marten actually stores the timestamp of when the event was added in the database, and that is part of the event's *metadata*. We can get to that any time we want without having to query the database or anything crazy like that,
just change the signature of the `Create` (or `Apply`) method to use an `IEvent` parameter, and we can get to the metadata.

```diff lang="csharp"
- public record User(UserCreated create)
+ public record User
{
    public Guid Id { get; init; }
    public string Name { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string Email { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string Phone { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public UserContactPrefs? ContactPreference { get; init; }

+    public static User Create(IEvent<UserCreated> userCreated) => 
+        new() { CreatedOn = userCreated.Timestamp };

    public static User Apply(UserNameProvided userNameProvided, User user) =>
        user with { Name = userNameProvided.UserName };
    public static User Apply(UserEmailProvided userEmailProvided, User user) =>
        user with { Email = userEmailProvided.Email };
    public static User Apply(UserPhoneProvided userPhoneProvided, User user) =>
       user with { Phone = userPhoneProvided.Phone };
    public static User Apply(UserContactPrefsProvided userContactPrefsProvided, User user) =>
        user with { ContactPreference = userContactPrefsProvided.ContactPref };
}
```

:::tip[Make sure to add the `using Marten.Events;` to bring in `IEvent<T>`]
:::

At this point our tests should <Badge text="Pass" variant="success" />.

## Adding Name History

Now let's add a property to our `User` projection that will keep track of the user's name history.

We know that a user can set their name, but maybe we allow them to change it later. 

:::note[This was a "lightbulb" moment for me]
What we are talking about is an event that is distinct from the event we used when we initially set the user name (`UserNameProvided`).

*That* event was created at a specific time in our understanding of users in our system.

To me, *real* software development is about writing code that boldly faces the unknowable future.
It might help to imagine a timeline where we have our system "out there", and we get a feature request: We want to allow our users to change their name.

This is an area where the Critter Stack shines. We can add a new event, add an `Apply`, and we are done. The less code I have to *change* to add a new feature, the better.
:::

<Steps>
1. Add a new property to the `User` projection
    ```diff lang="csharp"
    public record User()
    {
       // ...
    +    public IList<string> NameHistory { get; init; } = [];
        // ...
    }
    ```
2. Create a new Event
    ```csharp
    public record UserNameChanged(string UserName);
    ```
3. Here is a test to add to your test class:
    ```csharp
    [Fact]
    public async Task KeepingHistoryOfNameChanges()
    {
        var store = DocumentStore.For(config =>
        {
            config.Connection("host=localhost;database=issues;password=password;username=user");
        });
        await using var session = store.LightweightSession();

        var userStreamId = Guid.NewGuid();
        session.Events.StartStream(userStreamId, new UserCreated(), new UserNameProvided("Bob Smith"));
        await session.SaveChangesAsync();

        var user = await session.Events.AggregateStreamAsync<User>(userStreamId);
        Assert.NotNull(user);
        Assert.Equal("Bob Smith", user.Name);
        Assert.Empty(user.NameHistory);

        session.Events.Append(userStreamId, new UserNameChanged("Robert Smith"));
        await session.SaveChangesAsync();

        user = await session.Events.AggregateStreamAsync<User>(userStreamId);
        Assert.NotNull(user);
        Assert.Equal("Robert Smith", user.Name);
        Assert.Single(user.NameHistory);
        user.NameHistory.ShouldContain("Bob Smith");
    }
    ```
</Steps>

Here's the scenario we are demonstrating with this test:

1. We have a user that starts off with providing the name "Bob Smith".
2. Later, they change want to change their name to "Robert Smith".
    - Maybe Bob got promoted to "Management", or maybe he's just a big Cure fan, we aren't here to judge.
3. We want to keep a history of the names they have used, so we can show that they were once "Bob Smith".

The history of names should not contain anything until they change the name, though.

You've done a bit of this already. If you are feeling brave, try to implement the `Apply` method for `UserNameChanged` yourself.

See if your tests <Badge text="Pass" variant="success" />. *All* of them.

If you are having trouble, here is a hint:


<details>
<summary>The Way I Did It (Solution **REVEALED!**)</summary>

I added the following method to the `User` projection:

```csharp
public static User Apply(UserNameChanged userNameChanged, User user) =>
    user with { 
            Name = userNameChanged.UserName, 
            NameHistory = [user.Name, ..user.NameHistory] 
        };
```
