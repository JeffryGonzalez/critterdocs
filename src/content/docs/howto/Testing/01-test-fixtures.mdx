title: Test Fixtures

We are using XUnit for our testing framework. The approaches shown here are specific to that library, but can be adopted to your choice of testing library in most cases.

## About Fixtures

For the most part, we won't be writing what you might think of as "unit tests". We will be writing integration tests, and we will be using the Marten DocumentStore to do that.

I like to call these kind of tests "System Tests", because these tests are testing the system or app I am building. They only include code or resources that are part of the system I am building. They do not include code or resources that are not part of the system I am building.
