As we begin our journey of learning how to "Think Like a Critter" using the Critter Stack, we will start with the most important thing any software does. 

It does "things". It provides value, it limits liability. If you look at a successful application, like maybe Amazon.Com, you can see that all of it - every pixel, ever line of code, every database table, every network request - is all about one thing. 

Getting you, the customer, to the point where we it can say "Thanks. We have more of your money now."

In the world when "things happen", there is a common term that is used. An *event*. An Event is something that happens, and it is always associated with a point on a timeline. 

I think we, as software developers (and maybe I'm just projecting here), is that we tend to think of software as "stuff". Database tables, buttons, network calls, all that. And of course it *is* all that, but it is easy to lose sight of
the fact that all of that is just a way to get to the point where we can say "Thanks. We have more of your money now." (or whatever your business is).

## Against "Entity Centrism"

A lot of software development patterns and tools emphasize the artifacts of building software. The database tables, the classes that represent that data to in our code, "services" that do things to that data. 

The term "Entity" is used a lot. 

:::tip[Definition: Entity]
Kind of using a Domain Driven Design (DDD) term here, but an entity is a thing that has a unique identity. It is something that can be identified and tracked over time. An entity is something that has a lifecycle, and it can change over time.

### The Problem With "Entities"

The problem with entity-thinking is that we have to know too much about our system before we build it. In the old days, you'd start your application by designing your database. You'd create a bunch of tables, and then you'd create a bunch of classes that represented those tables. You'd create a bunch of services that did things to those tables.

I always thought that was a bit backwards. I mean, sure, we need to know what our data looks like, but we don't need to know everything about it before we start building our application. Not only do we not know everything about it, we can't know everything about it.

Maybe part of this is just because historically, the database and database schema was the most inflexible part of our application, but we've moved on from that.

You might feel like the presentation of this course is a bit "fake". Maybe even what is being called now "Vibe Based Coding". That I am just making stuff up as I go along. 

But I think that is a good thing. I think it is a good thing to start with the things we know, what we need, and then build on that.

But starting your application with an *entity-centric* approach just doesn't allow for that very well. We seem to be doomed to recreating some form of the dreaded "Waterfall" over and over again.


### Events and *Event-Centrism*

With event sourcing we start our thinking about the system not in terms of the "data" (entities), but in terms of what happens in our system. 

An event isn't a programming thing, really. I mean everyone has an idea of what it means when you say like "Oh, I went to this cool event last weekend". It might be a little hard to get a group of people to agree on a definition of "event", but we all know what it means.

:::tip[Definition: Event]
An event is something that happened, and it is always associated with a point on a timeline.

It is a record of something that has already happened.

For example, this morning, I:

- Turned off Alarm Clock
- Got out of bed
- Started Coffee
- Went to the bathroom
- Brushed my teeth
- Got my Coffee
- Watched the following YouTube videos:
    - [The Critter Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHCEX7dxMJI&list=PLLqH9ArXIrN651Qw9cdmgMoa8PbE0rN1-&pp=0gcJCXcEOCosWNin)
    - [Video Game Crap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5AYuNdj69M)


And the list goes on and on. Those are all "events".

That's all we mean. We will emphasize the things that happen in our system as our starting point.

Enough - let's get started.
