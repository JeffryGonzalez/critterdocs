title: What We'll Learn 
---

I'll admit: I had a hard time getting started building an application with the Critter Stack. I had a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of experience, but I found in many places that experience - that was hard earned and had severed me
well - was a hindrance to me. I had to unlearn a lot of things that I thought I knew about building applications.

The "Critter Stack" is an amalgamation of several tools and libraries. 

I heard someone say once (and I can't remember where, sorry!) that a **library** is "code your code uses", and a **framework** is "code that uses your code". The Critter Stack is a framework. But it is made up of several libraries.

You can use the Marten library as a document store in any old .NET application or API project. It's a reasonable (and, IMO, some ways superior) alternative to using Entity Framework Core, or MongoDB.

You can use the Wolverine library as a safer version of common .NET libraries like MediatR. 

Both of these libraries are documented well ([See References](/reference/jasperfx)), and I tried to learn to use them by reading the documentation like most developers do: As a last resort.
